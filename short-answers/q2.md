# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
`HTTP` stands for ***Hypertext Transfer Protocol*** -  It is the standard for communication over the internet

The `HTTP Request/Response cycle` is the ***pattern*** of **communication** used by two computers communicating using the HTTP protocol. It works like this:

        The program/computer making the request is the client. The client must initiate a request. A server can’t reach out and send Responses to clients on its own. It just waits for incoming requests. That program/computer responding to the request is called the server. The server must already be up and running and ready to accept incoming requests.

>The request and response sent between the client and server each contain important information including:
 - The request URL of the specific requested resource
 - The request verb — what it wants the server to do (post something new, send back some data, update or delete something)
 - The response status code (did the request succeed?)
 - The response body (the data sent back to the client)
