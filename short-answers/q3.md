# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer
When a website is visited, the browser (client) sends the request to the sites server, and the server responds with a `status code`. The status code is a code given back to indicate wether the HTTP request has been successfully completed.

>The server sends the HTTP status code - it is given back to the client
