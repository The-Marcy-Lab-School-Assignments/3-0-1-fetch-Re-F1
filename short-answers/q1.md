# Question
Please define what each HTTP verb does. Then, provide an example of when you would use it.

- GET
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE

# Answer
1. GET - In `C.R.U.D` : `Reading`. 
    > HTTP GET method is used for fetching data
    >
    >To retrieve data, we employ the HTTP GET method. When you visit a webpage, your browser sends GET requests to the server to fetch HTML, images, and other resources

2. POST - In `C.R.U.D` : `Create`. 
    >HTTP POST method is used when creating new resources
    >
    >We use the HTTP POST method to create new resources. For example, when a user submits a form on a website, the form data is sent to the server using POST to create a new record in a database.

3. PUT/PATCH - In `C.R.U.D` : `Update` - Used for updating resources
     >HTTP PATCH is used to update specific fields
     > .PATCH allows for partial updates, like changing a userâ€™s email address. 
     >
     >HTTP PUT is used to replace the entire resource.
     >PUT, on the other hand, replaces the entire resource, useful when you need to update all fields.

4. DELETE - In `C.R.U.D` : `Delete`
    >HTTP DELETE is used to delete resouces
    > 
    >When you delete a post on a social media platform, a DELETE request is sent to the server to delete that specific post.
