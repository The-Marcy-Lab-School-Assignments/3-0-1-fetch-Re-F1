# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - **Response.ok** property returns true if the status is in the 200 range. Immeditately tell us if our request was successful and, if not, why

2. `Response.status` - The **Response.status** property tells us the numerical status code. Immediately tell us if our request was successful and, if not, why

3. `Response.url` - returns the full URL of the property that we fetched

4. `Response.headers` - Accessing the headers property on the response object gives you the ability to look into the HTTP headers returned by the request:
